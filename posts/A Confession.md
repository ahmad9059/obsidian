**Hey,**  
Just wanted to clarify something first â€” _khadija_ameen000_ is my only beloved sister (you can even cross-verify with my fatherâ€™s name ðŸ˜‚).

I wanted to say that yes, I do have feelings for you. Iâ€™m genuinely interested, but I donâ€™t expect anything in return. I completely respect whatever your response may be. I just felt it was important to express my feelings honestly and respectfully.

Secondly, I also want to focus on improving myself and achieving something meaningful in life. I want to become good at what I do â€” and only then, maybe, pursue something more.

Iâ€™ve never messaged you on WhatsApp because I was afraid you might not be interested, and I didnâ€™t want to make anything uncomfortable. But after seeing your stories, I felt like I should at least try.

Also, I thought _areeshali653_ was a fake account at first, so I unfollowed because I didnâ€™t get any response. But when you shared pictures with me, I realized itâ€™s actually your account.

And if youâ€™re okay with it, you can accept my follow request on Instagram ðŸŒš.
