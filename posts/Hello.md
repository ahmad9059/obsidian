_Hey Areesha, I just wanted to say something calmly and clearly â€” not to bother you, but just to clear up the confusion respectfully._

_I know the follow/unfollow thing probably came off really wrong. I genuinely didnâ€™t mean to hurt or disrespect you â€” I was overthinking everything, especially after you didnâ€™t accept the request. I got nervous and thought maybe I messed up. But I want to be honest â€” I care about how you feel. If you want I can share the login/pass of my account_

_About my sister (_khadija_ameen000_) â€” sheâ€™s really just my sister. I never meant to play any games or hide anything. I understand how it mightâ€™ve looked, but that wasnâ€™t my intention at all._

_Iâ€™m focusing on growing â€” as a person and in my career. I want to be someone whoâ€™s stable, mature, and has something to offer. And yeah, part of that is learning how to handle feelings better too._

_You donâ€™t have to reply or do anything â€” I just hope you know my intentions were always sincere. Wishing you nothing but peace and happiness, no matter what ðŸŒ¸._
