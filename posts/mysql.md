## Database

Database is a collection of interrelated data.

- A **database** is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
- It stores data in tables, rows, and columns, allowing efficient retrieval and manipulation.
- Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

## DBMS

DBMS(Database Management System) is software used to create, manage, and organize databases.

- A **DBMS** is software that manages and controls database operations like storing, retrieving, and updating data.
- It ensures data consistency, security, and integrity while providing an interface for users to interact with the database.
- Examples include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. 🚀

## What is RDBMS

- RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) - is a DBMS based on the concept of tables (also called relations).
- Data is organized into tables(also known as relations) with rows(records) and columns(attributes).
- E.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server etc.

## SQL 

SQL is **Structured Query Language** - used to store, manipulate and retrieve data from RDBMS.

We use SQL for **CRUD** Operations:

- **CREATE** - To Create databases, tables, insert tuples etc.
- **READ** - To read data present int the database.
- **UPDATE** - Modify already insert data.
- **DELETE** - Delete database, table or specific data point/tuple/row or multiple rows.

**NOTE :** SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive. E.g., **select** is the same as **SELECT** in SQL.

#### Create Database

We can use the the following command to create the database.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

#### Delete Database

We Can use the **DROP** command to delete the database.

```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```

#### Select/Use the Database

We can use the **USE** command to select db and perform operation.

```sql
USE db_name;
```
### SQL vs MySQL

SQL is a language used to perform CRUD operations in Relational DB, while MySQL is a RDBMS that uses SQL.

#### Creating Table

We can create the table in db using the **CREATE TABLE** command whole syntax is given below.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name(
column_name1 datatype constraint;
column_name2 datatype constraint;
column_name3 datatype constraint;
);
```

## SQL Data Types

In SQL, data types define the kind of data that can be stored in a column or variable.

| Datatype    | Description                                                        | Usage         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| **CHAR**    | String (0-255), can store characters of fixed length               | `CHAR(50)`    |
| **VARCHAR** | String (0-255), can store characters up to given length            | `VARCHAR(50)` |
| **BLOB**    | String (0-65535), can store binary large object                    | `BLOB(1000)`  |
| **INT**     | Integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)                          | `INT`         |
| **TINYINT** | Integer (-128 to 127)                                              | `TINYINT`     |
| **BIGINT**  | Integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)  | `BIGINT`      |
| **BIT**     | Can store x-bit values. x can range from 1 to 64                   | `BIT(2)`      |
| **FLOAT**   | Decimal number - with precision to 23 digits                       | `FLOAT`       |
| **DOUBLE**  | Decimal number - with 24 to 53 digits                              | `DOUBLE`      |
| **BOOLEAN** | Boolean values 0 or 1                                              | `BOOLEAN`     |
| **DATE**    | Date in format of YYYY-MM-DD ranging from 1000-01-01 to 9999-12-31 | `DATE`        |
| **TIME**    | HH:MM:SS                                                           | `TIME`        |
| **YEAR**    | Year in 4-digit format ranging from 1901 to 2155                   | `YEAR`        |

*Note* - CHAR is for fixed length & VARCHAR is for variable length strings. Generally, VARCHAR is better as it only occupies necessary memory & works more efficiently.

*Signed & Unsigned* :
We can also use UNSIGNED with datatypes when we only have positive values to add. Eg - UNSIGNED INT

TINYINT UNSIGNED (0 to 255)

TINYINT (-128 to 127)

## Types of SQL Commands

1. **DDL(Database Definition Language):** Used to create, alter, delete database objects like tables, indexes, etc. (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, RENAME, TRUNCATE).
2. **DQL(Database Query Language):** Used to retrieve data from databases. (SELECT).
3. **DML(Database Manipulation Language):** Used to modify the database. (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
4. **DCL(Database Control Language):** Used to grant & revoke permissions. (GRANT, REVOKE).
5. **TCL(Transaction Control Language):** Used to manage transactions, (COMMIT, ROLLBACK, START TRANSACTIONS, SAVEPOINT).

## DATABASE related Queries
---

```mysql
CREATE DATABASE db_name; -- used to create database
```

```mysql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_name; -- create database if database not exist of this name.
```

```mysql
DROP DATABASE db_name; -- delete database
```

```mysql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db_name; -- delete database if exists
```

```mysql
SHOW DATABASES; -- show all databases
```

```mysql
SHOW TABLES; -- used to show all tables in particular database
```


## Table related Queries
---

### Create Tables

We can use the following syntax to create the table or design the scheme of table.

```mysql
CREATE TABLE table_name(
column_name1 datatype constraint;
column_name2 datatype constraint;
);
```

*Example*

```mysql
CREATE TABLE student(
	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT NOT NULL
);
```

### Select & View ALL columns

```mysql
SELECT * FROM table_name; -- display whole table
```

#### Insert

```mysql
INSERT INTO table_name
(colname1, colname2);
VALUES
(col1_v1, col2_v1),
(col1_v2, col2_v2);
```


## Keys
---

### Primary Key

It is a column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row. (a unique id). There is only 1 Primary Key and it should not be *NOT null*

### Foreign Key

A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that refers to the primary key in another table. There can be multiple FKs. FKs can be have duplicate & null values.

![](/posts/assets/mysql/img-1.webp)

### Secondary Key

Secondary key may or may not be unique field. Some times records are required to access by a field other than the primary key. In these situations another key that is used is called secondary key.

### Composite Key

Composite key consists of two or more than two fields. Composite key is also designed as a primary key. It is created in a situation when no single field fulfills the property of uniqueness. To make unique more than one field are combined and used as primary key.

## Constraints
---

SQL constraints are used to specify **rules** for data in a table.

- **NOT NULL** : columns cannot have null value. *col1 INT NOT NULL*
- **UNIQUE** : all values in column are different. *col2 UNIQUE*
- **PRIMARY KEY** : makes a column unique & not null but used only for one. *id INT PRIMARY KEY*. also declare as *PRIMARY KEY (id)*.

#### Foreign Key

Prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.

```mysql
CREATE TABLE temp(
cust_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) references customer(id)
);
```

#### DEFAULT

sets the default value of a column

```mysql
salary INT DEFAULT default_value;
```

#### CHECK

It can limit the values allowed in a column.


```mysql
CREATE TABLE city(

	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	city VARCHAR(50),
	age INT,
	CONSTRAINT age_check CHECK (age>= 16 AND city="Delhi")
);
```

```mysql
CREATE TABLE newTab (
age INT CHECK (age>=18)
);
```

## Select in Detail
---

#### SELECT

The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

```mysql
SELECT col1,col2 FROM table_name;
```

#### To Select All

```mysql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```


*Tip:* **DISTINCT** Keyword Removes duplicate rows from query results.

Syntax: 

```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```


## Where Clause
---

To define some conditions

```mysql
SELECT col1,col2 from table
WHERE condition(s).
```

```mysql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks > 80;
SELECT * FROM student WHERE city="Multan";
```

## Operator in WHERE

- **Arithmetic Operators** : + , - , * , / , %
- **Comparison Operators** : = , != , > , >= , < , <=
- **Logical Operators** : AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN, ALL, LIKE, ANY
- **Bitwise Operators** : & , |

#### Operators

- *AND* (to check for both conditions to be true)

```mysql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks > 80 AND city="Multan";
```

- *OR* (to check for one of the conditions to be true)

```mysql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks > 90 OR city="Lahore";
```

- **BETWEEN** : select for a given range

```mysql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks BETWEEN 80 AND 90;
```


- **IN** : (matches any value in the list)

```mysql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE city IN ("Multan","Karachi")
```

- **NOT** : (to negate the given condition)

```mysql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE city NOT IN ("Multan", "Karachi")
```

## Limit Clause

The limit clause is used to sets an upper limit on number of(tuples)rows to be returned.

```mysql
SELECT * FROM student LIMIT 3;
```

```mysql
SELECT col1,col2 FROM table_name
LIMIT number;
```


## Order by Clause

To sort in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

```mysql
SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY city ASC;
```

```mysql
SELECT col1,col2 FROM table_name ORDER BY col_name(s) ASC;
```


## Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values, and return a single value.

- COUNT()
- MAX()
- MIN()
- SUM()
- AVG()

Get Maximum Marks

```mysql
SELECT MAX(marks) FROM student;
```

Get Average marks

```mysql
SELECT AVG(marks) FROM student;
```


## Group By Clause

Group rows that have the same values into summary rows.
It collect data from multiple records(rows) and groups the result by one ore more column.

Generally we use the group by with some *aggregation function*.

Count number of students in each city

```mysql
SELECT city, count(name)
FROM student
GROUP BY city;
```


## HAVING Clause
---

Similar to WHERE i.e., applies some condition on rows.
Used when we want to apply any *condition after grouping*.

Count number of students in each city where max marks cross 90.

```mysql
SELECT city, count(rollno)
FROM student
GROUP BY city
HAVING MAX(marks) > 90;
```


## General Order
---

*SELECT* column(s)
*FROM* table_name
*WHERE* condition
*GROUP BY* column(s)
*HAVING* condition
*ORDER BY* column(s) *ASC*;

Example:

```mysql
SELECT city
FROM student
WHERE grade = "A"
GROUP BY city
HAVING MAX(marks) > 90
ORDER BY city DESC;
```


## Table related Queries
---

*UPDATE* is used to update existing rows in a table.

```mysql
UPDATE table_name
SET col1=val1, col2=val2
WHERE condition;
```

```mysql
UPDATE student
SET grade = "O"
WHERE grade = "A";
```


*DELETE* is used to delete the existing rows in a table

```mysql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

```mysql
DELETE FROM student
WHERE marks < 33;
```


## Foreign Key
---
A **foreign key (FK)** is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link between data in two tables. It refers to the **primary key (PK)** in another table, ensuring data integrity and enforcing referential constraints.

```mysql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);
```

## Cascading for FK
---

#### On Delete Cascade

When we create a foreign key using this option, it deletes the referencing rows in the child table when the referenced row is deleted in the parent table which has a primary key.
#### On Update Cascade

When we create a foreign key using UPDATE CASCADE the referencing rows are updated in the child table when the referenced row is updated in the parent table which has a primary key.

```mysql
CREATE TABLE teacher(
	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) references dept(id)
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
    ON DELETE CASCADE
    
);
```


## Alter

The **ALTER** is used to change the schema of table in a database.

1. **ADD** Column

```mysql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN column_name datatype constraint;
```


2. **DROP** Column

```mysql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
```


3. **RENAME** Column

```mysql
ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME TO new_table_name;
```


4. **CHANGE** Column(rename)

```mysql
ALTER TABLE table_name
CHANGE COLUMN old_name new_name new_datatype new_constraint;
```


5. **MODIFY** Column(modify datatype/ constraint)

```mysql
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY col_name new_datatype new_constraint;
```


## Truncate
---

The **TRUNCATE** is used to delete the data of table in database.

```mysql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name ;
```


## Joins in SQL
---

**JOIN** is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

### 1. Inner Join

Returns records that have matching values in both tables
![img2](/posts/assets/mysql/img-2.png)
*Syntax*

```mysql
SELECT column(s)
FROM tableA
INNER JOIN tableB
ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;
```


*Example*

```mysql
SELECT *
FROM student
INNER JOIN course
ON student.student_id = course.student_id;
```

**Tip:** SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name. Aliases are often used to make column names more readable. An alias only exists for the duration of that query. An alias is created with the `AS` keyword.

```mysql
SELECT CustomerID AS ID
FROM Customers;
```

### 2. Left Join

Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
![img3](/posts/assets/mysql/img-3.png)
**Syntax**

```mysql
SELECT columns(s)
FROM talbeA
LEFT JOIN tableB
ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;
```

**Example**

```mysql
SELECT *
FROM student as s
LEFT JOIN course as c
ON s.student_id = c.student_id;
```


### 3. Right Join

Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table

![img4](/posts/assets/mysql/img-4.png)

**Syntax**

```mysql
SELECT column(s)
FROM tableA
RIGHT JOIN tableB
ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;
```

**Example**

```mysql
SELECT *
FROM student as s
RIGHT JOIN course as c
ON s.student_id = c.student_id;
```


### 4. Full Join

Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

![img5](/posts/assets/mysql/img-5.png)

```mysql
SELECT * FROM student AS s
LEFT JOIN course AS c
ON s.student_id = c.student_id
UNION 
SELECT * FROM student AS s
LEFT JOIN course AS c
ON s.student_id = c.student_id;
```

### Left Exclusive Join

Exclusive joins in SQL are used to retrieve records that exist in one table but not in the other when performing a **LEFT JOIN** or **RIGHT JOIN**.

A Left Exclusive Join retrieves records from the left table that do not have matching records in the right table.

![img6](/posts/assets/mysql/img-6.png)

```mysql
SELECT * 
FROM student AS a
LEFT JOIN course AS b 
ON a.id = b.id
WHERE b.id IS NULL;
```

### Right Exclusive Join

A **Right Exclusive Join** retrieves records from the right table that do not have matching records in the left table.

![img7](/posts/assets/mysql/img-7.png)

```mysql
SELECT * 
FROM student AS a
RIGHT JOIN course AS b 
ON a.id = b.id
WHERE a.id IS NULL;
```


### Self Join

It is a regular join but the table is joined with itself.

```mysql
SELECT column(s)
FROM table as a
JOIN table as b
ON a.col_name = b.col_name
```


## Union
---

It is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements. Gives UNIQUE records.

- every SELECT should have same no. of columns
- columns must have similar data types
- columns in every SELECT should be in same order

```mysql
SELECT column(s) FROM tableA
UNION
SELECT column(s) FROM tableB
```

and we can also use the **UNION ALL** to give all the values including the duplicates records.
## SQL Sub Queries
---

A Subquery or Inner query or a Nested query is a query within another SQL query. It is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition.

![img8](/posts/assets/mysql/img-8.png)

It involves 2 select statements.

```mysql
Syntax
SELECT column(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE col_name operator
( subquery );
```


### Example with FROM

```mysql
SELECT MAX(marks)  
FROM (SELECT marks FROM student WHERE city = 'Delhi') AS temp;
```


## MySQL Views

A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

A view always shows up-to-date data. The database engine recreates the view, every time a user queries it.

```mysql
CREATE VIEW v1 AS  
SELECT rollno, name, marks  
FROM student;
```


## Stored Procedures in MySQL

A **Stored Procedure** is a precompiled set of SQL statements stored in the database that can be executed repeatedly. It helps encapsulate logic in a modular way, improving **reusability, maintainability**, and **performance**.


### Benefits of Stored Procedures

- **Modularity** – Write once, use many times. 
- **Performance** – Precompiled for faster execution.
- **Security** – Users can be granted access to run procedures without giving access to underlying tables.
- **Reduced network traffic** – Fewer queries sent between application and server.

### Syntax: Creating a Stored Procedure

```mysql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (
    IN param1 datatype,
    OUT param2 datatype,
    INOUT param3 datatype
)
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements go here
END //

DELIMITER ;
```


**Example:**

```mysql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByID(IN emp_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### Calling a Stored Procedure

```mysql
CALL GetEmployeeByID(1);
```

If there are `OUT` or `INOUT` parameters:

```mysql
CALL ProcedureName(@out_param);
SELECT @out_param;
```

### Types of Parameters

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|`IN`|Input only (passed by value).|
|`OUT`|Output only (value returned).|
|`INOUT`|Both input and output (passed by reference).|

### Modifying or Dropping Stored Procedures

```mysql
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS procedure_name;
```

- **Alter is not supported**: You must drop and recreate the procedure.

### Control Structures in Stored Procedures

#### IF-ELSE

Used to execute different blocks of code based on a condition.

```mysql
IF condition THEN
    -- statements
ELSE
    -- statements
END IF;
```

**Example:**

```mysql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE CheckAge(IN age INT)
BEGIN
    IF age >= 18 THEN
        SELECT 'You are an adult' AS result;
    ELSE
        SELECT 'You are a minor' AS result;
    END IF;
END //

DELIMITER ;

-- Call the procedure
CALL CheckAge(20);  -- Output: You are an adult
CALL CheckAge(15);  -- Output: You are a minor
```


#### CASE Statement

Used as an alternative to multiple `IF` statements when checking several conditions.

**Syntax:**

```mysql
CASE variable
    WHEN value1 THEN statement1;
    WHEN value2 THEN statement2;
    ELSE statement_default;
END CASE;
```

**Example:**

```mysql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GradeResult(IN grade CHAR(1))
BEGIN
    CASE grade
        WHEN 'A' THEN SELECT 'Excellent' AS Result;
        WHEN 'B' THEN SELECT 'Good' AS Result;
        WHEN 'C' THEN SELECT 'Average' AS Result;
        ELSE SELECT 'Fail or Invalid Grade' AS Result;
    END CASE;
END //

DELIMITER ;

-- Call the procedure
CALL GradeResult('A');  -- Output: Excellent
CALL GradeResult('D');  -- Output: Fail or Invalid Grade
```


#### WHILE Loop

Repeats a block of statements while the condition is true.

**Syntax**

```mysql
WHILE condition DO
    -- statements
END WHILE;
```

**Example:**

```mysql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE CountToFive()
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 1;
    
    WHILE i <= 5 DO
        SELECT CONCAT('Count: ', i) AS Output;
        SET i = i + 1;
    END WHILE;
END //

DELIMITER ;

-- Call the procedure
CALL CountToFive();
```


#### ## `REPEAT` Loop

Similar to `WHILE`, but checks the condition **after** executing the block.

**Syntax:**

```mysql
REPEAT
    -- statements
UNTIL condition
END REPEAT;
```

**Example:**

```mysql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE RepeatExample()
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 1;

    REPEAT
        SELECT CONCAT('Repeat Count: ', i) AS Output;
        SET i = i + 1;
    UNTIL i > 5
    END REPEAT;
END //

DELIMITER ;

-- Call the procedure
CALL RepeatExample();
```


### Error Handling

Use `DECLARE ... HANDLER` to define how to handle errors.

**Syntax**

```mysql
DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
BEGIN
    -- Error handling code
END;
```


**Create the procedure with error handler**

```mysql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE InsertStudent (
    IN student_id INT,
    IN student_name VARCHAR(50)
)
BEGIN
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
    BEGIN
        SELECT 'Error occurred while inserting student!' AS ErrorMessage;
    END;

    -- Attempt to insert student
    INSERT INTO students (id, name) VALUES (student_id, student_name);

    -- Continue execution even if error occurred
    SELECT 'Insert attempt completed.' AS Status;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```


### Show Existing Stored Procedures

```mysql
SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db = 'your_database';
```

**Or to view the code:**

```mysql
SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name;
```
