I recently uploaded a video showcasing my Arch Linux (btw) setup just for fun, and to my surprise, it went viral within the Linux community! Since then, I’ve received numerous messages asking about the installation process. Although I wanted to make a detailed video tutorial, my laptop's older specs make it difficult to handle both recording and installation simultaneously. So, I’ve decided to write this article to guide you through the installation process using my dotfiles and the installation script from Ja.Kool.It. Below, you’ll find a step-by-step guide to get started.

## 1. Install ArchLinux With Minimal Configuration

- ### Make a Bootable USB

1. First Download ArchLinux ISO from official site : [Download Link](https://archlinux.org/download/)
2. Second Download for Your Operating System [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases)
3. Extract the Ventoy Folder and Write it on your USB.
4. Copy ArchLinux ISO into USB.
   if you Don't Know how to use ventoy read this [article](https://itsfoss.com/use-ventoy/)

- ### Boot From USB

1. Restart Your Computer and Press the Boot Menu key according to your Computer.
2. In Boot Menu Select Your USB
3. It will open ventoy and show you all ISO file available in USB
4. Select the ArchLinux ISO and Open in Normal Mode.

- ### Connect to Internet

1. For wired internet you don't need to do anyting
2. For wireless Command Given Below

```bash
$ iwctl

[iwd]#
```

From the [iwd]# prompt you will need figure out your device name. Then, assuming you know the SSID (service set identifier) of your wireless network, go ahead and connect like so:

```bash
[iwd]# device list

# You should see something like this:
#
#                            Devices
# -------------------------------------------------------------
#   Name          Address          Powered    Adapter    Mode
# -------------------------------------------------------------
#   wlan0         ...              on         ...        ...

[iwd]# station YOURDEVICE connect YOURSSID
```

For a secured wireless network, you will be prompted for the WiFi password. Once you enter the correct password, you’ll be off to the races!

- ### Making Partition Ready for Archinstall
  for that first we will use the `cfdisk` to make partitions and then `mfks` for formatting that

```bash
$ lsblk
```

if will show your all partitions and there information

```bash
$ cfdisk
```

it show you all of your information about your drives

You have to make 3 partitions

1. EFI boot Partition - Type Must be EFI System
2. Swap Partition - Type Must be Swap Partition
3. Root Partition - Type Must be Linux File System

after Make Partitions write and exit the cfdisk and Run these commands and just change paths

```bash
$ mkfs.ext4 /path/to/root/partition
$ mfks.vfat -F 32 /path/to/efi/partition
$ mkswap /path/to/swap/partition
```

we will use the pre-mounted disk configuration for that run

```bash
$ mkdir /mnt/archinstall
$ mount /path/to/root/partition /mnt/archinstall
$ mkdir /mnt/archinstall/boot
$ mount /path/to/efi/partition/ /mnt/archinstall/boot
$ swapon /path/to/swap/partition
```

now we are done with partitioning the partitions

- ### Update System and Run ArchInstall

```bash
$ pacman -Sy archinstall archlinux-keyring

$ archinstall
```

- ### Actual Installation Start Here

After running the `archinstall` command it will show you something like this.

## 3. My Dotfiles Configuration

To set up your environment using these dotfiles, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmad9059/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

2. **Backup Existing Dotfiles**: Before copying new configurations, it's wise to back up your current dotfiles:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/dotfiles_backup
cp ~/.config ~/dotfiles_backup -r
cp ~/.tmux.conf ~/dotfiles_backup
cp ~/.zshrc ~/dotfiles_backup
```

3. **Copy New Configurations**:
Remember you must in `dotfiles` folder to run following commands

```bash
cp -r .config ~/
cp .zshrc ~/
cp -r .themes ~/.themes
cd .icons
cp .icons.zip ~/
cd ~/
unzip .icons.zip
rm .icons.zip
```

After the installation, you can start using the configured applications. Open your `GTK settings` and set the widget theme to `Andromeda-dark`, the icon theme to `Dracula`, and the mouse cursor to `Future-black Cursors`.
#### Packages `pacman`:
Install of these Packages using `pacman`

```bash
sudo pacman -S  foot alacritty lsd bat tmux neovim tldr obs-studio vlc yazi
```

#### Packages `yay`(Optional):

Install of these Packages Using `yay`. Remember they are according to my preference like I have install vscode, telegram etc.

```bash

```


Congratulations! You have successfully completed the installation.
