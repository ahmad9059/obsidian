## Lecture No. 1 Notes
### 1. What is Good Software?
Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable and usable
### 2. Categories of Software Products
#### Generic products
Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them.
Examples – PC software such as editing, graphics programs, project management tools; CAD software; software for specific markets such as MS Word.
#### Customized products
Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own needs. 
Examples – embedded control systems, air traffic control software, traffic monitoring systems.
### 3. Program vs. Software Product:
It’s like the difference between `“rain” (software) and “individual drops of water”` (a program.)

Program is a set of instruction related each other where as Software Product is a collection of program designed for specific task
Programs are usually small in size where as Software Products are usually large in size
Programs provide Limited functionality and less features where as Software Products provides more functionality

### 4. Essence of Practice
**Process:**
A series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end

*George Polya* outlines the essence of the problem solving process:

- Understand the problem (communication and analysis).
1. Plan a solution (modeling and software design).
2. Carry out the plan (code generation).
3. Examine the result for accuracy (testing and quality assurance).
### 5. Software Engineering
Software engineering is the process of analyzing user needs and designing, constructing, and testing end user applications that will satisfy these needs through the use of software programming languages
#### Formal Definition(s)
[Software engineering is] the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economical software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.

**The IEEE definition:**
Software Engineering: (1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.  (2) The study of approaches as in (1).
### 6. Five Activity Generic Framework
- **Communication**: communicate with customer to understand objectives and gather requirements
- **Planning**: creates a “map” defines the work by describing the tasks, risks and resources, work products and work schedule. 
- **Modeling:** Create a “sketch”, what it looks like architecturally, how the constituent parts fit together and other characteristics. 
- **Construction:** code generation and the testing. 
- **Deployment:** Delivered to the customer who evaluates the products and provides feedback based on the evaluation. 
### 7. George Polya’s Model
- Understand the problem
- Plan the solution
- Carry out the plan
- Examine the results
