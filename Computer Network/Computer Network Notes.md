## Computer Network
A **computer network** is a system that connects multiple computers and devices to share resources, data, and applications. Networks allow for communication between devices, and they’re fundamental to both small-scale setups (like local area networks in offices) and large-scale systems (like the internet).
### 1. Major Components of a Computer Network are:
- **NIC(Network Interface Card) :**  network interface card is a piece of hardware that allows computers to communicate with other devices on a network. It can also be called an Ethernet card, LAN card, or network adaptor.
- **Hub**: A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple computers within a network. When one computer sends data, the hub receives it and broadcasts it to all other connected devices, regardless of the intended recipient. Hubs operate at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model and are sometimes referred to as "repeaters" because they amplify the signal to ensure it reaches all connected devices.
- **Switch**: A switch is a network device that connects multiple devices and directs data only to the intended recipient using MAC addresses, enhancing efficiency and reducing network congestion. It operates primarily at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
