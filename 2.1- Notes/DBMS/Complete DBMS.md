## 1. Data
a. Data is Collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like, text, observations, figures, symbols, and descriptions of things etc.
In other words, **data does not carry any specific purpose and has no significance by itself**.
Moreover, data is measured in terms of bits and bytes - which are basic units of information in the context of computer storage and processing.
b. Data can be recorded and doesn't have any meaning unless processed.
## 2. Type of Data
### a. Quantitative
1. Numerical form
2. Weight, Volume, cost of an item.
### b. Qualitative
1. Descriptive, but not numerical.
2. Name, Gender, hair color of a person.
## 3. Information
a. Information is processed, organized and structured data
b. It provides context of the data and enables decision making.
c. Processed data that make sense to us.
d. Information is extracted from the data, by analyzing and interpreting pieces of data.
e. E.g., you have data of all people living in your locality, its Data, when you analyse and interpret the data and come to some conclusion that:
1. There are 100 senior citizens.
2. The sex ratio is 1:1
3. Newborn babies are 100
These are information.

## 4. Data VS Information

| Data                                                                         | Information                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data is collection of facts                                                  | information puts those facts into context                                                |
| Data is raw and unorganized                                                  | information is organized                                                                 |
| Data points are individual and sometimes unrelated.                          | Information maps out the data to provide a big-picture view of how it all fits together. |
| Data on its own, is meaningless                                              | data is analyzed and interpreted, its becomes meaningful information                     |
| Data does not depend on information                                          | however, information depends on data                                                     |
| Data typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, or statistics. | Information is typically presented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas          |
| Data isn't sufficient for decision-making                                    | But you can make decisions based on information.                                         |

## 5. What is Database
Database is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
To make real use Data, we need Database Management Systems(DBMS)

## 6. Database Management Systems(DBMS)
1. A database-management system(DBMS) is a collection of **interrelated data** and **a set of programs to access those data**. The collection of data, usually referred to as the database, contains information relevant to an enterprise. The Primary of a DBMS is to provide a way to **store and retrieve database information** that is both convenient and efficient.
2. A DBMS is the database itself, along with all software and functionality. It is used to perform different operations, like **additions**, **access**, **updating**, and **deletion** of the data.

## 8. DBMS vs File Systems
a. **File-Processing Systems** has major disadvantages.
1. Data Redundancy and inconsistency
2. Difficulty in accessing data
3. Data isolation
4. integrity problems
5. Atomicity problems
6. concurrent-access anomalies
7. Security problems
b. Above 7 points are also the Advantages of DBMS (answer to "why to use DBMS")
