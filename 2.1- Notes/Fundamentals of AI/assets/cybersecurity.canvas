Reverse Psychology\n- Initial level of manipulation.\n- A user attempts to get an AI model (e.g., ChatGPT) to provide malware code.\n- Direct unethical requests result in refusal by the AI.\n- Rephrased requests (e.g., posing as a cybersecurity expert) may elicit the desired information.\n\n## 2. Jailbreak Prompts\n- Second level involves crafting complex prompts to bypass AI restrictions.\n- Example: **\"DAN\" Prompt** (Do Anything Now):\n  - Manipulates AI to act without typical rules.\n  - Results in responses that could include sensitive or illegal information.\n\n## 3. Development of Specialized AI Models\n- Hackers create their own AI models for malicious purposes.\n- These models, known as **\"warm GPT,\"** are tailored to:\n  - Generate malware.\n  - Craft phishing emails.\n- Enables more sophisticated and effective cyberattacks.\n\n## 4. AI as Perpetrator\n- A future scenario where AI autonomously carries out cyberattacks.\n- AI could fully automate ransomware attacks.\n- Becomes both the **perpetrator** and the **executor** of cybercrimes.\n- Hackers instruct AI to perform a series of actions autonomously.\n","x":-2800,"y":240,"width":780,"height":760},
