## Database

Database is a collection of interrelated data.

## DBMS

DBMS(Database Management System) is software used to create, manage, and organize databases.

## What is RDBMS

- RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) - is a DBMS based on the concept of tables (also called relations).
- Data is organized into tables(also known as relations) with rows(records) and columns(attributes).
- E.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server etc.

## SQL 

SQL is **Structured Query Language** - used to store, manipulate and retrieve data from RDBMS.

We use SQL for **CRUD** Operations:

- **CREATE** - To Create databases, tables, insert tuples etc.
- **READ** - To read data present int the database.
- **UPDATE** - Modify already insert data.
- **DELETE** - Delete database, table or specific data point/tuple/row or multiple rows.

**NOTE :** SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive. E.g., **select** is the same as **SELECT** in SQL.

### SQL vs MySQL

SQL is a language used to perform CRUD operations in Relational DB, while MySQL is a RDBMS that uses SQL.
