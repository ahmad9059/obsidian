Did you know you can earn points towards a 100% off AWS Foundational or Associate Level exam with AWS Educate + Emerging Talent Community (ETC)? This is a new ETC reward option that opened up yesterday!  
  
Here is the process :  
  
1. Join AWS Educate (Free - just needs an email id) [https://lnkd.in/dcGxYNEB](https://lnkd.in/dcGxYNEB)  
  
2. Work through one of their badge eligible courses and complete the assessment. The shortest one is their "Introduction to Generative AI" badge which is useful learning anyway.  
  
3. Wait a few days. You 55will emails from credly with the badge and another one inviting you to join the ETC  
  
4. Join ETC and start doing all the activities assigned. Day 1 you get a lot of activities (You can earn close to 2000 points) and then you get 6 activities every week. The activities are simple. Watch a video or read a post and answer a few simple questions to show you have actually done the activity. You earn about 60 points every time.  
  
5. Keep earning points regularly towards the reward tier.  
4500 points required for Foundational vouchers and 5200 for Associate level vouchers. Takes approx 45 to 60 days of maybe 10-15 minutes every day.  
  
1. While doing these activities you ALSO need to complete a couple of additional pieces of work.  
a) Complete AWS Skill Builder exam prep course for the AWS certification you're seeking  
b) Complete at least one of the AWS Skill Builder certification practice exam or official practice question set with a score of 70% or higher.  
  
Both of these are free and are well aligned with the certification you want to take and hence are not wasted time. Just don't rely upon them as the only source for your certification preparation.  
  
1. Once you have completed all the tasks, you can request a 100% off exam voucher!  
  
I hope people make the best out of this opportunity.  
If you get stuck in this process, I suggest going through online forums first for support and then raising a support query with AWS if you cant find anything to help.  
  
Good Luck!
