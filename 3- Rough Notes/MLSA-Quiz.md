## Azure AI Fundamentals

Fundamental AI Concepts

- **Generative AI uses a language model to create original content in response to a prompt.**
- **Object detection**
- **Speech synthesis**

Fundamentals of machine learning

- **Regression**
- **Precision**
- **To evaluate the aggregate difference between predicted and actual label values**
- **Automatically run multiple training jobs using different algorithms and parameters to find the best model**


Fundamentals of Azure AI services

- **A single-service resource for each AI service**
- **Input a key and endpoint into the studio**
- **A bundle of several AI services in one resource**

Fundamentals of Computer Vision

- **Pixels**
- **Azure AI services**
- **Objects**

Fundamentals of Facial Recognition

- **A set of coordinates for each face, defining a rectangular bounding box around the face**
- **Extreme angles**
- **Create a Face resource, and open Vision Studio**

Fundamentals of optical character recognition

- **Azure AI services**
- **Results arranged in pages, lines, and words**

Fundamentals of Text Analysis with the Language Service

- **Key phrase extraction**
- **The document is negative.**
- **When the language is ambiguous**

Fundamentals of question answering with the Language Service

1. **Import the existing FAQ document into a new knowledge base.**
2. **Question Answering**

Fundamentals of conversational language understanding


- **Azure AI Language**
- **Define a "city" entity and a "GetTime" intent with utterances that indicate the city entity.**
- **The endpoint and key for the application's prediction resource**

Fundamentals of Azure AI Speech

- **Azure AI services**
- **Text to speech**
- **It performs real-time or batch transcription of audio into a text format.**

Fundamentals of Azure AI Document Intelligence

- **Azure AI Document Intelligence or Azure AI services resource**
- **Financial services and legal, US tax, US mortgage, and personal identification documents**
- **It is used to extract text, layout, and key-value pairs from documents, providing locations of text on a page identified by bounding box coordinates.**

Fundamentals of Knowledge Mining and Azure AI Search

- **JSON**
- **An indexer converts documents into JSON and forwards them to a search engine for indexing.**
- **The full-text.**

Fundamentals of Generative AI

- **Models that use deep learning to process and understand natural language on a massive scale.**
- **Microsoft Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service**
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio**

Responsible generative AI


- **To document the purpose, expected use, and potential harms for the solution**
- **Content filters**
- **To enable you to gather feedback and identify issues before releasing the solution more broadly**
