🎉 𝘼 𝙅𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙣𝙚𝙮 𝙤𝙛 𝙂𝙧𝙤𝙬𝙩𝙝 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙍𝙚𝙨𝙞𝙡𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚: 𝙈𝙮 𝘿𝙎𝘼 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙚𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙮! 🚀

  

As 2024 draws to a close, I’m beyond thrilled to share a significant milestone in my journey—𝗜 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗺𝘆 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗔𝗹𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗺𝘀 (𝗗𝗦𝗔) 𝗷𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆!🎯


I want to take a moment to thank the people who supported me throughout this journey. In Pakistan, especially in my city, Multan, there is literally no awareness or culture around DSA, CP, or platforms like LeetCode. When I approached my seniors and peers, I realized many were unfamiliar with DSA/CP or coding culture in general. Unfortunately, this lack of a supportive coding environment extended to my university as well. I have been following him for a long time, and his journey continues to motivate me to keep pushing forward.

This journey began at the end of December 2023 when I made a New Year’s resolution to conquer DSA in 2024. Today, I stand proud of sticking to that promise despite countless challenges, frustrations, and moments of self-doubt. For those who know me, I consistently shared my weekly progress on LinkedIn, although I struggled with maintaining a regular posting schedule. However, I never stopped learning.


💡 There were times when solving a LeetCode problem felt like an insurmountable mountain. I faced roadblocks, took breaks, and came back with a renewed determination. This process taught me patience, persistence, and the value of embracing both the highs and the lows.

  

📖 During this journey, I created 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗲𝘀(shared below) that reflect every bit of effort I poured into understanding the concepts. These notes became my lifeline, and I hope they inspire others on a similar path.

  

✅ Some key accomplishments along the way:

  

• Solved 𝟲𝟬𝟬+ 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀 across multiple platforms.

• Shared my learning process and progress, which resonated with so many amazing people here on LinkedIn.

  

🌟 When I started, I had 𝘇𝗲𝗿𝗼 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗲𝗱𝗜𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. Today, I’m grateful to have built a network of 𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆 𝟲,𝟬𝟬𝟬 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗱𝘂𝗮𝗹𝘀 who’ve inspired and motivated me. Thank you all for being a part of my journey!

Although I dream of diving into Competitive Programming (CP), my current circumstances don’t allow it just yet. So, for 2025, I’ve set my sights on mastering 𝗙𝘂𝗹𝗹-𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗪𝗲𝗯 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 —a new chapter I’m eager to embark on.

  

To everyone reading this: Believe in your goals, embrace the process, and never give up on becoming the best version of yourself. Let’s keep growing together! 💪
