# Arrays

Objects allow you to store keyed collections of values. That’s fine.

But quite often we find that we need an _ordered collection_, where we have a 1st, a 2nd, a 3rd element and so on. For example, we need that to store a list of something: users, goods, HTML elements etc.

It is not convenient to use an object here, because it provides no methods to manage the order of elements. We can’t insert a new property “between” the existing ones. Objects are just not meant for such use.

There exists a special data structure named `Array`, to store ordered collections.

## [Declaration](https://javascript.info/array#declaration)

There are two syntaxes for creating an empty array:

```js
let arr = new Array();
let arr = [];
```

Almost all the time, the second syntax is used. We can supply initial elements in the brackets:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
```

Array elements are numbered, starting with zero.

We can get an element by its number in square brackets:

```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];

alert( fruits[0] ); // Apple
alert( fruits[1] ); // Orange
alert( fruits[2] ); // Plum
```

We can replace an element:

```js
fruits[2] = 'Pear'; // now ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"]
```

…Or add a new one to the array:

```js
fruits[3] = 'Lemon'; // now ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear", "Lemon"]
```

The total count of the elements in the array is its `length`:

```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
alert( fruits.length ); // 3
```

We can also use alert to show the whole array.

```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
alert( fruits ); // Apple,Orange,Plum
```

An array can store elements of any type.

For instance:

```js
// mix of values
let arr = [ 'Apple', { name: 'John' }, true, function() { alert('hello'); } ];
// get the object at index 1 and then show its name
alert( arr[1].name ); // John
// get the function at index 3 and run it
arr[3](); // hello
```

## Get last elements with “at”

Let’s say we want the last element of the array.

Some programming languages allow the use of negative indexes for the same purpose, like `fruits[-1]`.

Although, in JavaScript it won’t work. The result will be `undefined`, because the index in square brackets is treated literally.

We can explicitly calculate the last element index and then access it: `fruits[fruits.length - 1]`.

```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
alert( fruits[fruits.length-1] ); // Plum
```

A bit cumbersome, isn’t it? We need to write the variable name twice.

Luckily, there’s a shorter syntax: `fruits.at(-1)`:

```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
// same as fruits[fruits.length-1]
alert( fruits.at(-1) ); // Plum
```

In other words, `arr.at(i)`:

- is exactly the same as `arr[i]`, if `i >= 0`.
- for negative values of `i`, it steps back from the end of the array.

## Methods pop/push, shift/unshift

A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_\(abstract_data_type\)) is one of the most common uses of an array. In computer science, this means an ordered collection of elements which supports two operations:

- `push` appends an element to the end.
- `shift` get an element from the beginning, advancing the queue, so that the 2nd element becomes the 1st.

Arrays support both operations.

In practice we need it very often. For example, a queue of messages that need to be shown on-screen.

There’s another use case for arrays – the data structure named [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_\(abstract_data_type\)).

It supports two operations:

- `push` adds an element to the end.
- `pop` takes an element from the end.

So new elements are added or taken always from the “end”.

A stack is usually illustrated as a pack of cards: new cards are added to the top or taken from the top:


For stacks, the latest pushed item is received first, that’s also called LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. For queues, we have FIFO (First-In-First-Out).

Arrays in JavaScript can work both as a queue and as a stack. They allow you to add/remove elements, both to/from the beginning or the end.

In computer science, the data structure that allows this, is called [deque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue).

**Methods that work with the end of the array:**

`pop`

Extracts the last element of the array and returns it:

```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"];
alert( fruits.pop() ); // remove "Pear" and alert it
alert( fruits ); // Apple, Orange
```


Both `fruits.pop()` and `fruits.at(-1)` return the last element of the array, but `fruits.pop()` also modifies the array by removing it.

`push`

Append the element to the end of the array:

```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange"];
fruits.push("Pear");
alert( fruits ); // Apple, Orange, Pear
```

The call `fruits.push(...)` is equal to `fruits[fruits.length] = ...`.

**Methods that work with the beginning of the array:**

`shift`

Extracts the first element of the array and returns it:

```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"];
alert( fruits.shift() ); // remove Apple and alert it
alert( fruits ); // Orange, Pear
```

`unshift`

Add the element to the beginning of the array:

```js
let fruits = ["Orange", "Pear"];
fruits.unshift('Apple');
alert( fruits ); // Apple, Orange, Pear
```

Methods `push` and `unshift` can add multiple elements at once:

```js
let fruits = ["Apple"];
fruits.push("Orange", "Peach");
fruits.unshift("Pineapple", "Lemon");
// ["Pineapple", "Lemon", "Apple", "Orange", "Peach"]
alert( fruits );
```

# Objects

As we know from the chapter [Data types](https://javascript.info/types), there are eight data types in JavaScript. Seven of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever).

In contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language. So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else.

An object can be created with figure brackets `{…}` with an optional list of _properties_. A property is a “key: value” pair, where `key` is a string (also called a “property name”), and `value` can be anything.

We can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in its file by the key. It’s easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a file.

An empty object (“empty cabinet”) can be created using one of two syntaxes:

```js
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {};  // "object literal" syntax
```

Usually, the figure brackets `{...}` are used. That declaration is called an _object literal_.
## Literals and properties

We can immediately put some properties into `{...}` as “key: value” pairs:

```js
let user = {     // an object
  name: "John",  // by key "name" store value "John"
  age: 30        // by key "age" store value 30
};
```

A property has a key (also known as “name” or “identifier”) before the colon `":"` and a value to the right of it.

In the `user` object, there are two properties:

1. The first property has the name `"name"` and the value `"John"`.
2. The second one has the name `"age"` and the value `30`.

The resulting `user` object can be imagined as a cabinet with two signed files labeled “name” and “age”.

We can add, remove and read files from it at any time.

Property values are accessible using the dot notation:

```js
// get property values of the object:
alert( user.name ); // John
alert( user.age ); // 30
```

The value can be of any type. Let’s add a boolean one:

```js
user.isAdmin = true
```

To remove a property, we can use the `delete` operator:

```js
delete user.age;
```

We can also use multiword property names, but then they must be quoted:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  "likes birds": true  // multiword property name must be quoted
};
```

The last property in the list may end with a comma:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
}
```

That is called a “trailing” or “hanging” comma. Makes it easier to add/remove/move around properties, because all lines become alike.


## Square brackets

For multiword properties, the dot access doesn’t work:

```js
// this would give a syntax error
user.likes birds = true
```

JavaScript doesn’t understand that. It thinks that we address `user.likes`, and then gives a syntax error when comes across unexpected `birds`.

The dot requires the key to be a valid variable identifier. That implies: contains no spaces, doesn’t start with a digit and doesn’t include special characters (`$` and `_` are allowed).

There’s an alternative “square bracket notation” that works with any string:

```js
let user = {};

// set
user["likes birds"] = true;

// get
alert(user["likes birds"]); // true

// delete
delete user["likes birds"];
```


Now everything is fine. Please note that the string inside the brackets is properly quoted (any type of quotes will do).

Square brackets also provide a way to obtain the property name as the result of any expression – as opposed to a literal string – like from a variable as follows:

```js
let key = "likes birds";

// same as user["likes birds"] = true;
user[key] = true;
```

Here, the variable `key` may be calculated at run-time or depend on the user input. And then we use it to access the property. That gives us a great deal of flexibility.

For instance:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

let key = prompt("What do you want to know about the user?", "name");

// access by variable
alert( user[key] ); // John (if enter "name")
```


The dot notation cannot be used in a similar way:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

let key = "name";
alert( user.key ) // undefined
```


## Computed properties

We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. That’s called _computed properties_.

For instance:

```js
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");

let bag = {
  [fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
};
alert( bag.apple ); // 5 if fruit="apple"
```


The meaning of a computed property is simple: `[fruit]` means that the property name should be taken from `fruit`.

So, if a visitor enters `"apple"`, `bag` will become `{apple: 5}`.

Essentially, that works the same as:

```js
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");
let bag = {};

// take property name from the fruit variable
bag[fruit] = 5;
```

…But looks nicer.

We can use more complex expressions inside square brackets:

```js
let fruit = 'apple';
let bag = {
  [fruit + 'Computers']: 5 // bag.appleComputers = 5
};
```

Square brackets are much more powerful than dot notation. They allow any property names and variables. But they are also more cumbersome to write.

So most of the time, when property names are known and simple, the dot is used. And if we need something more complex, then we switch to square brackets.

## Property value shorthand

In real code, we often use existing variables as values for property names.

For instance:

```js
function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    // ...other properties
  };
}

let user = makeUser("John", 30);
alert(user.name); // John
```

variable is so common, that there’s a special _property value shorthand_ to make it shorter.

Instead of `name:name` we can just write `name`, like this:


```js
function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name, // same as name: name
    age,  // same as age: age
    // ...
  };
}
```

We can use both normal properties and shorthands in the same object:

```js
let user = {
  name,  // same as name:name
  age: 30
};
```

## Property names limitations

As we already know, a variable cannot have a name equal to one of the language-reserved words like “for”, “let”, “return” etc.

But for an object property, there’s no such restriction:

```js
// these properties are all right
let obj = {
  for: 1,
  let: 2,
  return: 3
};

alert( obj.for + obj.let + obj.return );  // 6
```

In short, there are no limitations on property names. They can be any strings or symbols (a special type for identifiers, to be covered later).

Other types are automatically converted to strings.

For instance, a number `0` becomes a string `"0"` when used as a property key:

```js
let obj = {
  0: "test" // same as "0": "test"
};

// both alerts access the same property (the number 0 is converted to string "0")
alert( obj["0"] ); // test
alert( obj[0] ); // test (same property)
```

## Property existence test, “in” operator
A notable feature of objects in JavaScript, compared to many other languages, is that it’s possible to access any property. There will be no error if the property doesn’t exist!

Reading a non-existing property just returns undefined. So we can easily test whether the property exists:

```js
let user = {};
alert( user.noSuchProperty === undefined ); // true means "no such property"
```

There’s also a special operator `"in"` for that.

The syntax is:

```js
"key" in object
```

For instance:

```js
let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };
alert( "age" in user ); // true, user.age exists
alert( "blabla" in user ); // false, user.blabla doesn't exist
```


Please note that on the left side of `in` there must be a _property name_. That’s usually a quoted string.

If we omit quotes, that means a variable should contain the actual name to be tested. For instance:


```js
let user = { age: 30 };

let key = "age";
alert( key in user ); // true, property "age" exists
```


Why does the `in` operator exist? Isn’t it enough to compare against `undefined`?

Well, most of the time the comparison with `undefined` works fine. But there’s a special case when it fails, but `"in"` works correctly.

It’s when an object property exists, but stores `undefined`:

```js
let obj = {
  test: undefined
};
alert( obj.test ); // it's undefined, so - no such property?
alert( "test" in obj ); // true, the property does exist!
```

In the code above, the property `obj.test` technically exists. So the `in` operator works right.

Situations like this happen very rarely, because `undefined` should not be explicitly assigned. We mostly use `null` for “unknown” or “empty” values. So the `in` operator is an exotic guest in the code.

## The "for..in" loop

To walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop: `for..in`. This is a completely different thing from the `for(;;)` construct that we studied before.

The syntax:

```js
for (key in object) {
  // executes the body for each key among object properties
}
```


For instance, let’s output all properties of `user`:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: true
};

for (let key in user) {
  // keys
  alert( key );  // name, age, isAdmin
  // values for the keys
  alert( user[key] ); // John, 30, true
}
```

Note that all “for” constructs allow us to declare the looping variable inside the loop, like `let key` here.

Also, we could use another variable name here instead of `key`. For instance, `"for (let prop in obj)"` is also widely used.
