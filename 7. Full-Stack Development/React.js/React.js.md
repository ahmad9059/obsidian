- React.js is a JavaScript library for building **user interfaces**.
- Developed by **Facebook** (now Meta).
- It is **component-based**, **declarative**, and allows for efficient UI updates.

## Key Features of React

- **Component-Based Architecture**: UI is built using reusable components.
- **Virtual DOM**: Updates only the changed parts, making React fast.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Props and state maintain a predictable data structure.
- **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: A syntax extension that lets you write HTML inside JavaScript.
- **Hooks**: Allow functional components to have state and other features.

## Mutable vs Immutable

### Mutable (Changeable)

- Mutable data types **can be changed** after creation.
- Example: **Objects & Arrays** are mutable.
