### ðŸ”¹ **Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)**

5. **Q5:**
    
    ```
    Process   Arrival Time   Burst Time   Priority (Lower = Higher)
    P1        0              10           3
    P2        2              5            1
    P3        3              8            2
    P4        5              2            4
    ```
    
    - Apply **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling**.
        
    - Find average waiting time and turnaround time.
        
6. **Q6:**
    
    ```
    Process   Arrival Time   Burst Time   Priority
    P1        0              4            2
    P2        1              3            1
    P3        2              1            3
    P4        3              2            2
    ```
    
    - Use **Non-Preemptive Priority**.
        
    - Lower priority number = higher priority.

### ðŸ”¹ **Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)**

7. **Q7:**
    
    ```
    Process   Arrival Time   Burst Time   Priority
    P1        0              5            2
    P2        1              3            1
    P3        2              8            4
    P4        3              6            3
    ```
    
    - Use **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**.
        
    - Draw Gantt chart and calculate average times.
        
8. **Q8:**
    
    ```
    Process   Arrival Time   Burst Time   Priority
    P1        0              7            3
    P2        2              4            1
    P3        4              1            2
    P4        5              5            2
    ```
    
    - Apply **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**.
        
    - Priority: smaller number = higher priority.

### ðŸ”¹ Bonus: Mixed Concept

9. **Q9:**  
    Compare **SJF (preemptive)** vs **Priority (preemptive)** for the following processes:
    
    ```
    Process   Arrival Time   Burst Time   Priority
    P1        0              6            2
    P2        1              2            1
    P3        2              8            3
    P4        3              3            2
    ```
    
    - Draw Gantt charts for both.
        
    - Compare average waiting and turnaround times.
        
10. **Q10:**  
    Create your own process table with 5 processes having random arrival, burst, and priority values. Then solve using **all 4 algorithms**:
    
    - SJF Non-Preemptive
        
    - SJF Preemptive
        
    - Priority Non-Preemptive
        
    - Priority Preemptive  
        Compare the performance of each.
