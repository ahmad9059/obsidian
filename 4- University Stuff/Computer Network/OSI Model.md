## OSI (Open System Interconnections):
It is a network architecture model based on the ISO standards. It is called the OSI model as it deals with connecting the systems that are open for communication with other systems. The OSI model has seven layers. The principles used to arrive at the seven layers can be summarized briefly as below:
1. Create a new layer if a different abstraction is needed.
2. Each layer should have a well-defined function. 
3. The function of each layer is chosen based on internationally standardized protocols.
