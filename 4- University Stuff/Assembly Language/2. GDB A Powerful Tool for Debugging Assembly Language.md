**GDB** (GNU Debugger) is a versatile tool that allows you to step through your assembly code line by line, examine the values of registers and memory locations, and identify the root cause of errors. It's an invaluable tool for understanding how your assembly code executes and debugging complex issues.

**Key GDB Commands for Assembly Debugging:**

1. **Starting GDB:**

**gdb your_program**

Replace your_program with the name of your assembled executable.

Running the Program:

**run**

 **Setting Breakpoints:**

break function_name

break * address

·  The first command sets a breakpoint at the beginning of a function. The second sets a breakpoint at a specific memory address.

·  **Stepping Through Code:**

· step: Executes the current instruction and stops at the next one.

· next: Executes the current line of source code and stops at the next line.

· continue: Continues execution until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.

1. **Examining Registers and Memory:**

o info registers: Displays the current values of all registers.

o print /x $eax: Prints the value of the EAX register in hexadecimal format.

o x/10x $esp: Examines 10 hexadecimal words starting from the ESP register.

2. **Other Useful Commands:**

o backtrace: Displays a stack trace of function calls.

o info breakpoints: Lists all active breakpoints.

o delete breakpoint <number>: Deletes a specific breakpoint.

o quit: Exits GDB.

**Real-World Example:**

Imagine you're debugging an assembly program that calculates the factorial of a number. You might use GDB to:

1. **Set a breakpoint** at the beginning of the factorial function.

2. **Step through the code** to observe how the function's logic works.

3. **Inspect the values of registers** like the stack pointer (ESP) and the base pointer (EBP) to understand how function calls and local variables are handled.

4. **Examine memory** to see how data is stored and manipulated.

5. **Modify registers and memory** to experiment with different inputs and outputs.
