In computer systems, floating-point numbers are represented using a specific format to efficiently store and manipulate real numbers. The most common format is the **IEEE 754 standard**.

**IEEE 754 Floating-Point Format:**

This standard defines two primary formats: single-precision (32-bit) and double-precision (64-bit). Each format consists of three main components:

1. **Sign Bit:** Determines whether the number is positive or negative.

2. **Exponent:** Represents the magnitude of the number.

3. **Mantissa:** Represents the precision of the number.

**Single-Precision Format:**

| **Field** | **Bits** | **Description**                   |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Sign      | 1        | 0 for positive, 1 for negative    |
| Exponent  | 8        | Biased exponent (127 is the bias) |
| Mantissa  | 23       | Significant digits of the number  |

**Double-Precision Format:**

| **Field** | **Bits** | **Description**                    |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Sign      | 1        | 0 for positive, 1 for negative     |
| Exponent  | 11       | Biased exponent (1023 is the bias) |
| Mantissa  | 52       | Significant digits of the number   |

**Example:**

Consider the decimal number 12.375. Its binary representation is 1100.011. To represent this number in single-precision IEEE 754 format:

1. **Sign:** The number is positive, so the sign bit is 0.

2. **Exponent:** We need to normalize the number to the form 1.xxx * 2^y. In this case, 12.375 = 1.100011 * 2^3. So, the exponent is 3 + 127 = 130, which is 10000010 in binary.

3. **Mantissa:** The mantissa is the fractional part of the normalized number, which is 100011.

Therefore, the single-precision representation of **12.375** is:

**0 10000010 10001100000000000000000**

**Machine-Level Representation of Floating-Point Operations:**

Floating-point operations are more complex than integer operations and often require specialized hardware units called Floating-Point Units (FPUs). The FPU handles the complex calculations involved in floating-point arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and various mathematical functions.
