In computer science, the terms Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are often used interchangeably, leading to confusion. While closely related, they represent distinct concepts with specific applications and theoretical underpinnings.
## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field focused on developing intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural language, recognizing objects, making decisions, solving problems, and learning from experience. AI systems exhibit cognitive abilities like reasoning, perception, and problem-solving across various domains. Some key areas of AI include:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. 
- Computer Vision: Allowing computers to "see" and interpret images and videos. 
- Robotics: Developing robots that can perform tasks autonomously or with human guidance. 
- Expert Systems: Creating systems that mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts.

One of the primary goals of AI is to augment human capabilities, not just replace human efforts. AI systems are designed to enhance human decision-making and productivity, providing support in complex data analysis, prediction, and mechanical tasks.

AI solves complex problems in many diverse domains like healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. For example:

- In [healthcare](healthcare.canvas), AI improves disease diagnosis and drug discovery.
- In [finance](finance.canvas), AI detects fraudulent transactions and optimizes investment strategies.
- In [cybersecurity](cybersecurity.canvas), AI identifies and mitigates cyber threats.

## Machine Learning (ML)

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subfield of AI that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks without explicit programming. ML algorithms use statistical techniques to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within datasets, allowing the system to make predictions, decisions, or classifications based on new input data.

*ML can be categorized into three main types:*

- **Supervised Learning:** The algorithm learns from labeled data, where each data point is associated with a known outcome or label. Examples include:
	- Image classification
	- Spam detection
	- Fraud prevention

- **Unsupervised Learning:** The algorithm learns from unlabeled data without providing an outcome or label. Examples include:
	- Customer segmentation 
	- Anomaly detection 
	- Dimensionality reduction

- **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback as rewards or penalties. Examples include:

	- [Robotics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-wIZuAA3EY) 
	- [Autonomous driving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OopTOjnD3qY)

For instance, an ML algorithm can be trained on a dataset of images labeled as "cat" or "dog." By analyzing the features and patterns in these images, the algorithm learns to distinguish between cats and dogs. When presented with a new image, it can predict whether it depicts a cat or a dog based on its learned knowledge.

*ML has a wide range of applications across various industries, including:*

- **Healthcare:** Disease diagnosis, drug discovery, personalized medicine Finance: Fraud detection, risk assessment, algorithmic trading
- **Marketing:** Customer segmentation, targeted advertising, recommendation systems 
- **Cybersecurity:** Threat detection, intrusion prevention, malware analysis 
- **Transportation:** Traffic prediction, autonomous vehicles, route optimization

ML is a rapidly evolving field with new algorithms, techniques, and applications emerging. It is a crucial enabler of AI, providing the learning and adaptation capabilities that underpin many intelligent systems.
